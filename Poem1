hi gauri kutti kamini
When you're sad and depressed,
I will be here to put a smile on your face.

When you're angry and frustrated,
I will be here to calm you down.

When you're hurt and in tears,
I will be here to wipe them away and mend the pain.

When you're lonely and have no one,
I will be here to comfort you.

When you're feeling unloved and unwanted,
I will be here to tell you how very important you are.

When you're having a bad day and need to lash out,
I will be here to let off steam.

When there is something on your mind that you need to say,
I will be here to listen and understand.

When you're lost in confusion,
I will be here to help you figure things out.

When you feel like you're going crazy,
I will be here to bring you back to sanity.

When you are so overwhelmed and need to get away,
I will be here with open arms so we can run away together.


BestFriend poem 
I promise that I will always be here for my loved ones,
today, tomorrow and forever!

If you’re feeling down; turn your frown upside down.
Put a smile on your face; take the world in your embrace.

Ask for a little help from the man up above.
And remember you have your best friend’s love.
